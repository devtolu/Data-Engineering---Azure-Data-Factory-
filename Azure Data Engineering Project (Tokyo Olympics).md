# Data Engineering End to End - Azure Data Factory

<B>Paris Olympics 2024 event</B>

<B>DESCRIPTION</B><BR>
This project provides a data engineering and anlytical journey into the Tokyo Olympic games dataset. Starting with CSVs on GitHub, the data is ingested into the Azure ecosystem via Azure Data Factory. It's initially stored in Azure Blob Storage after which transformation is carried out in the Azure Data Factory using Data Flows and then moved to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. The enriched data, once again housed in ADLS Gen2, undergoes advanced analytics in Azure Synapse. The insights are finally visualized in Azure Synapse or Power BI, offering a comprehensive view of the dataset.

<b>Dataset Used:</b> The data contains details of  goal of this project is to identify the trends in the previously organised olympic games, specifically to see the analysis and data visualisation for the athletes, medals, events etc.  By performing a data analysis using Data Flow in Azure Data Factory, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can help tell a story and assist in making informed decisions about the olympic games, which country won highest the number of medals, countries with the highest medals.

Tools: Azure Data Factory (Azure), and Power BI.

Skills: Azure(Transformation using Data Flow, Azure Blob Storage) Data querying, data validation, JOINs & UNION clauses, aggregation, datetime convertion, filtering, subqueries, CTEs, conditions, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and presentation.


Outputs:
